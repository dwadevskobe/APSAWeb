          <h2> Asian & Pacific-Islander Student Alliance </h2>
          <h3> Vision </h3>
          <p>  We, the students of University of California at San Diego (UCSD), come together to provide a forum to deal with the problems and concerns of UCSD Asian and Pacific-Islander (API) students, especially those deemed “underrepresented” by the Student Affirmative Action Committee (SAAC); to try and create an environment where issues such as those political, educational, cultural and social can be addressed; to increase awareness about our API history and heritage within the university and the community; to unite as a community resource to represent a common voice and thereby empower ourselves; and to serve as a support network for building bonds and addressing differences between students. The Asian and Pacific-Islander Student Alliance is a non-profit organization. </p>
          <h3> General Body Meetings (GBMs):</h3>
          <p>  Even week Tuesdays 6:30pm-8pm at the Cross Cultural Center's Comunidad (right above Burger King in Price Center East on the 2nd floor) </p>
          <h3> Board Meetings: </h3>
          <p> Every Monday from 6:00pm-9/10:00pm at the Cross Cultural Center's Conference Room (2nd floor of Price Center East)
              -- guests and GBMers are welcome to sit in on board meetings! </p>
